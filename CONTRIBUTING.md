# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to kube-events!

<br/>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (for integration testing)
- kubectl configured

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somaz94/kube-events.git
cd kube-events
make build
```

<br/>

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
```

### 2. Make changes and verify

```bash
# Format and lint
make fmt
make vet
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Build binary
make build

# Verify
./kube-events version
```

### 3. Commit with conventional commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

| Prefix | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `ci:` | CI/CD changes |
| `chore:` | Maintenance (deps, version bumps) |
| `refactor:` | Code restructuring |
| `test:` | Test additions/changes |

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add event count threshold filter"
```

### 4. Sign off your commits (DCO)

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/somaz94/.github/blob/main/DCO.md) instead of a CLA. Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer — add it with `-s`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: your change"
```

A CI check rejects pull requests whose commits are not signed off. See [DCO.md](https://github.com/somaz94/.github/blob/main/DCO.md) for the full text and how to fix unsigned commits.

### 5. Push and create a PR

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.
